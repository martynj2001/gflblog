For those of us who have been used to years of silky and slightly foaming toothpaste, initially this is a little bit of a shock to the sensitive nerve ending of the tongue and mouth, however I implore you to persist. You do adjust and once you add  some water and give your teeth a good scrub you may find yourself pleasantly surprised that your teeth do actually feel and look clean.   \n    One little pot has lasted about the same amount of time as a large tube to toothpaste for two of us. From a financial point of view it is therefore more expensive. From a trying to live a plastic free, chemical free, sustainable living, supporting small local and national businesses point of view we have been very happy.  \n    You can recycle the pot or re use it.  \n    Personally, I am not a fan of the spearmint so I have ordered the peppermint option to try next.

You do adjust and once you add  some water and give your teeth a good scrub you may find yourself pleasantly surprised that your teeth do actually feel and look clean.   \n    One little pot has lasted about the same amount of time as a large tube to toothpaste for two of us.

From a trying to live a plastic free, chemical free, sustainable living, supporting small local and national businesses point of view we have been very happy.  \n    You can recycle the pot or re use it.  \n    Personally, I am not a fan of the spearmint so I have ordered the peppermint option to try next.
